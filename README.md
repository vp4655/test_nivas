# test_nivas
Solution for job application at nivas

## Run

1. Za slice dio zadatka samo otvoriti ``./index.html``
2. Rješenja ostalih zadataka su u ``./test_odgovori/Zadatak*``
3. Svaki od zadataka ima pripadajući html za lakšu provjeru izvršavanja

#### Napomena

Plugin file-ovi nalaze se u ``./lib`` folderu jer nisam bio siguran imate li instaliran npm za automatski dohvat
